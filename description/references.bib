    abstract = {Most anomalies fail to hold up to currently acceptable standards for empirical finance. With microcaps mitigated via NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns, 65\% of the 452 anomalies in our extensive data library, including 96\% of the trading frictions category, cannot clear the single test hurdle of the absolute \$t\$-value of 1.96. Imposing the higher multiple test hurdle of 2.78 at the 5\% significance level raises the failure rate to 82\%. Even for replicated anomalies, their economic magnitudes are much smaller than originally reported. In all, capital markets are more efficient than previously recognized.Received June 12, 2017; editorial decision October 29, 2018 by Editor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh.

 abstract = {This paper documents that strategies which buy stocks that have performed well in the past and sell stocks that have performed poorly in the past generate significant positive returns over 3- to 12-month holding periods. We find that the profitability of these strategies are not due to their systematic risk or to delayed stock price reactions to common factors. However, part of the abnormal returns generated in the first year after portfolio formation dissipates in the following two years. A similar pattern of returns around the earnings announcements of past winners and losers is also documented.},
